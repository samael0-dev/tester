            <div class="about">Daki is one of the primary antagonists in the Entertainment District Arc of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. She is a demon affiliated with the Twelve Kizuki, being the secondary holder of the position of Upper Rank Six a position she shares with the primary holder, her older brother, Gyutaro.
            Over a century ago, Daki was a human child by the name of Ume, who lived in the Rashomon Riverbank of Yoshiwara, the lowest class of the Entertainment District, before she and Gyutaro were turned into demons personally by Doma, who was Upper Rank Six at the time.
